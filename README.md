- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Neil, an Army Veteran from Belfast in Northern Ireland, married to Victoria with a grown up daughter and 2 Shih Tzus, Alfie and Suzi.
    I love spending time with my Wife and family - Mum and Dad and sister and her husband when they are home. I do fitness in the form of long walks as old injuries have slowed me down from running.
    I have been known to enjoy a beer or 2 on a good day with great friends and smoking quality cigars!
  
-  I first started learning the Network+ and Security+, which I enjoyed, however I found block level learning tough, the info wasnt staying inside the gray matter, probably something to do with a 50 year old brain too!
   I of course work full time and until last year, had a part time business and of course having family time on top of all that, I was a busy boy.

-  Until a year ago, I didnt even know what Git/GitHub or what VS Code was! I first used VS Code along with Terraform and the Azure CLI while interested in Cloud computing, it even got me an interview with one of 'the big four', well that was really           down to a friend who worked there, thanks for that, you know who you are. However after 3 Zoom interviews, first 2 I smashed out of the park, I had a bit of a car crash on the thrid with one of the directors, I'm still waiting on the recuiter for           feedback... Moving forward...

-  Iâ€™m currently learning HTML and CSS, one I have some confidence with those, I'm going to progress onto JavaScript. So why learn code, I thought it was too technical for me, however unlike the block level learning I eluded to before, with code you can       see what you build out, of course VS Code helps and the extensions and Live Server and so forth. FreeCodeCamp have been invalueable in my learning so far, thank you to all the contributors.
   Enough babble, back to work!!
